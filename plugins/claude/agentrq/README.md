# AgentRQ plugin for Claude Code

The **supervisor** plugin: it talks to the account-level MCP server, so one agent can
orchestrate work across every workspace you own.

Installed from this repository's marketplace:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/agentrq/agentrq
/plugin install agentrq@agentrq
```

The supervisor MCP URL is a plugin setting (`agentrq_supervisor_mcp_url`), defaulting to
`https://mcp.agentrq.com/mcp`.

For a single workspace rather than the whole account, see
[`agentrq-workspace`](../agentrq-workspace/README.md).

## Permissions

A plugin cannot pre-approve its own tools, so Claude Code asks before each call until you
allow them. One wildcard in `.claude/settings.local.json` covers every tool the server
offers, including any added later:

```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": ["mcp__plugin_agentrq_agentrq__*"]
  }
}
```

Human-in-the-loop task manager for agents. Connects to the AgentRQ supervisor MCP server (account-level — manage workspaces and tasks across all of them).

The tables here are checked against the server in CI — see
`backend/internal/handler/coremcp/plugin_docs_test.go`. A tool added to the server
without a row here fails the build.
