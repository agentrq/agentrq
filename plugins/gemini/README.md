# AgentRQ extension for Gemini CLI

The **supervisor** extension: it connects [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)
to AgentRQ's account-level MCP server, so one agent can orchestrate work across every
workspace you own.

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/agentrq/agentrq
```

The server is `https://mcp.agentrq.com/mcp`. It answers an unauthenticated request with
a 401, Gemini CLI discovers its OAuth endpoints from that, and you sign in with your
AgentRQ account; `/mcp auth agentrq` starts the sign-in by hand. To use a self-hosted
AgentRQ, define a server named `agentrq` in `~/.gemini/settings.json`; a server defined
there takes precedence over the extension's:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agentrq": { "type": "http", "url": "https://agentrq.example.com/mcp" }
  }
}
```

> Previously this lived in a separate `agentrq-gemini-extension` repository. If you
> installed it from there, uninstall it (`gemini extensions uninstall agentrq`) and
> install it again from the URL above.

## Where the files are

Gemini CLI installs an extension from a git URL, and reads its manifest from the
repository root. So the manifest is [`gemini-extension.json`](../../gemini-extension.json)
at the root of this repository, and its `contextFileName` points back here, at
[`GEMINI.md`](GEMINI.md), the instructions loaded into every session.

Installing from GitHub prefers the latest release's source archive to a clone, so the
extension that users get, and its updates, follow AgentRQ's release tags.

Gemini CLI also loads `skills/`, `agents/`, `commands/`, `hooks/` and `policies/` from
an extension's root, which is this repository's root. Adding a folder with one of those
names there adds it to the extension.

## Permissions

Gemini CLI asks before each tool call. To allow every tool the server offers, including
any added later, add a policy file such as `~/.gemini/policies/agentrq.toml`:

```toml
[[rule]]
mcpName = "agentrq"
decision = "allow"
priority = 100
```

That also allows the deletes, which cannot be undone. Add a rule deciding `ask_user`
with a `toolName` and a higher priority for any tool you want to keep asking about.

**Prompts:** `new-workspace`, `setup-agentrqd` and `workspace-status`.

This table is checked against the server in CI — see
`backend/internal/handler/coremcp/plugin_docs_test.go`. A tool added to the server
without a row here fails the build.
