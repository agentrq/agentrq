/**
 * Starting an agent from the workspace, rather than from the machine.
 *
 * `useAgentLaunch` answers "this machine is open — which workspace should it
 * run?". This is the same launch from the other end: the workspace is open and
 * offline, and the question is which machine should run it. The pairing is the
 * same one either way, so the eligibility rules are imported rather than
 * rewritten — two copies of "why can't I launch" would eventually disagree,
 * and the one somebody is reading would be the wrong one.
 *
 * What it deliberately cannot answer is whether an agent is already starting
 * elsewhere: this end knows the workspace, not every machine's sessions, and
 * the window between "launched" and "connected" is invisible from here. The
 * server closes that window (`ActiveSessionForWorkspace`), and a refusal from
 * it is shown as it arrives.
